# Bridge

According to Coinmarketcap.com, "Blockchain bridge is a connection that transfers tokens and arbitrary data from one chain to another, with both chains having different protocols, rules and governance models. Bridging provides a compatible way to interoperate securely on both sides."

Solana cash token bridge with multiple blockchains will allow our users to move tokens between networks quickly and cost-effectively, thereby increasing interoperability.

Mansa Trade will bridge with the following blockchain:

 - Binance Smart Chain
 - Polygon Matic
 - Ethereum
 - Polkadot
 - Cardano
 - Avalanche
