# What is Mansa Trade

## Connecting the world through one global payment system.

Mansa Trade is a decentralized global payment system that aims to accelerate the adoption of the Solana network worldwide by adding more transaction capacity to the network.

With Solana being one of the fastest blockchains, our mission is to make the technology widely accessible to the masses through our core products by developing user-friendly mobile apps to facilitate peer a peer-to-peer payment system enabling users to send and receive funds securely with average cost per transaction of $0.00025.

Mansa Trade focuses on cross-chain technology to bridge the gap between global financial systems through cryptocurrency by enabling multi-connectivity between Mansa Trade and various blockchains, thereby increasing interoperability all on one platform. 

With the Implementation of MansaCard, Mansa Trade aims to be a fully decentralized financial institution backed by different financial products to reform Defi in various ways. MansaCard will be available to qualified users of our mobile app to facilitate.

40% of our total supply is allocated towards our excessive reward system vested daily for 20 Years. These tokens are distributed to users of our mobile app as rewards based on the total number of daily transactions initiated by each user. This backs up our mission statement of adding more transaction capacity to the Solana network. More details on the reward system will be announced shortly.
